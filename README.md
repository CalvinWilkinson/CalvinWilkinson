### Hello and Welcome!!

I have been into computers and techology going back to when I first started in high school.  I started poking around and getting interested in computers in 1998.
My brother at the time was taking a class in high school for **Visual Basic 4** and I picked it up one day and I was instantly hooked. The rest is history!!

I have dealt with various industries from things such as the steel industry, industrial automation, retail, consulting, even the world of taxes.  In those industries I have done website front end, backend, low level PLC controls and ModBus communications.  Cross platform mobile apps, databases, and the cloud using Azure.  I have also done large enterprise applications using microservices to old legacy systems for small companies.   Some of the languages and technologies that I have dealt with are PLC
ladder logic, C++, C#, SQL, TypeScript, JavaScript, NodeJS, Azure Functions, CosmosDB, SQL, MongDB, Entity Framework, Python and more.
